### **Snake Game (Online Web Game)**  

Hey there! 😊 Do you want to play a fun **Snake Game** on your computer or phone? This is a simple game where you control a snake that moves around the screen. Your job is to **eat the food** and grow bigger! 🐍🍎  

### **How Does It Work?**  
1. The snake starts as a small line and moves in one direction.  
2. You can **control** the snake using the arrow keys (⬆️⬇️⬅️➡️).  
3. When the snake **eats food**, it grows longer.  
4. But be careful! **If the snake hits the wall or its own body, the game is over!** 🚫  

### **What Do We Use to Make It?**  
We create this game using:  
- **HTML** 🏗️ (for building the game screen)  
- **CSS** 🎨 (to make it look cool)  
- **JavaScript** 🎮 (to make the snake move and work)  

Would you like to see the code or play the game? 😊
